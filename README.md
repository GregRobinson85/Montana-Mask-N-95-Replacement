# Montana-Mask-N-95-Replacement
This repository is for parts source files and information regarding 3D printable medical masks.

Regarding files in .zip
The main source file is an F3D. I've scaled the original mask into two new parts, creating a Medium and a Small in addition
to the original, which I'm calling Large. The scale factor is noted in the file names (90% and 80%, respectively for Medium
and small). The letters 'L' 'M' and 'S' have been engaved on the face plate of each mask to avoid confusion.

However the source file does not contain the plastic filter attachment and so I could not scale it in an IGES or STP/STEP. 
The file for the filter piece is included in this .zip and is called MontanaMaskFilterAdult. This is the Large, 100% scale. 
For the smaller versions the corresponding filter pieces will have to be scaled within the slicer application prior to printing.

Materials: I'm using TPU for the mask because it's what I have on hand. Any type of flex should work but remember that these will be in
contact with medical providers' skin. PLA was orignally suggested but it's a bad idea. The seal will not work well at all. 

PLA or PETG or other rigid material should be used for the filter adapter which, again, should be scaled according to the size mask it
will fit into.
